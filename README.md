# ML Models

A C++ machine learning library built from the ground up. Implementing various ML algorithms and models using fundamental linear algebra and optimization techniques.

## Features

- **Linear regression** with gradient descent optimization
- **Logistic regression** for binary classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification
- Matrix operations library (addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse)
- Loss functions: MSE, MAE, RMSE, L1, L2, Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Regression: R2, Adjusted R2, MSE, MAE, RMSE
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC
- Regularization: L1 (Lasso) & L2 (Ridge)
- Real-world examples:
  - Housing price prediction (Linear Regression)
  - Heart disease prediction (Logistic Regression)

## Prerequisites

- C++14 or higher
- CMake 3.16+

## Examples

### Housing Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

A complete example demonstrating linear regression on a real-world housing dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset):

- Dataset: 545 housing samples with 12 features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.)
- Features: Z-score normalization
- Model: Linear regression with L2 regularization
- Optimizer: Batch gradient descent
- Metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²

### Heart Disease Prediction (Logistic Regression)

A binary classification example using logistic regression on the Framingham Heart Study dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression):

- Dataset: Framingham Heart Study - 10 Year CHD Risk
- Features: 15 clinical features (age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, etc.)
- Preprocessing: Z-score normalization
- Model: Logistic regression with L2 regularization
- Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
- Optimizer: Batch gradient descent
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC

Run the examples:
```bash
./Build
```
